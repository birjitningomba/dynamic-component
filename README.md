# dynamic-component
The project demonstrates adding dynamic angular components.
The dynamic components are loaded, configured and added.
The dynamic components are also moved around when more than one component is added.
The dynamic components are expected to be sortable which is currently being not working due to a bug at angular material cdk.

Note: There may be bugs with the project.
